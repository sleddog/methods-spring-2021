# ShippingCostAPI
Disclaimer: The route generated by the swagger UI is not able to be used unless the server which the UI is running on is running on the current system(currently only I have access to it). Due to this, no one else will be able to actually use the API, but the code is provided to show how I set up the endpoint with swagger.

# What it Does
This API communicates with a large database with information about items that have been shipped all around the world. In another project, my team and I have created a project that calculates the cost for each item in the database. This swagger UI is a way to demonstrate the endpoint we have created.

# Instructions

Run the swagger UI server, click on the Get route->"Try it out", enter in a single id from the database(ex: 10301), or multiple, separating them with dahses(ex: 10301-4417), followed by hitting "Execute". The json corresponding to each shipping item will be returned and visible on the screen. Each item has return values of the estimated shipping cost, along with the maximum and minimum possible shipping costs.
