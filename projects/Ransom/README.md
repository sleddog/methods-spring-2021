# DartEulerSolutions

For the final assignment I chose to do the first Project Euler problem in Dart.
Dart is a language I've seen and heard about a fair amount, but haven't used much,
so I figured I'd give it a shot with something simple. The problem I solved was:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3,
5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of
3 or 5 below 1000.
