## Overview
This is the web app for my new project called BetterClockApp. I hate how my alarms, timers, and other various clock related applications are not synced across all of my devices unless I buy into a single ecosystem. 
So, this web app is designed to be used as a synced place for all of my applications. However, given the time that I have to do, I focused more on this project on getting the web application built around it. 

Most of this code is done in C#, similar to my FizzBuzz project, and built on the ASP.net framework for ease of use amongst all environments.
I chose C# for this web app as I have similar background in it from my internship, where I built something similar to interact with all the apis within my company!!
