# ToDo React Application, Alexis Tingey

### **Overview:**
This folder houses source code for a user interactive ToDo list React App. There are two folders src and public, and a package.json. Public holds the index.html file that holds the entire thing together. Src contains index.js as well as the React components.

### **The App:**
This small but powerful app is a front-end visualization of a custom todo list, created by the user. The user can visit the page, and input several tasks on their todo list to help keep up on things. 

**Using the App**
 While it's not quite up for deployment, the following link will lead you right to CodeSandbox where you can play around with the interface.
