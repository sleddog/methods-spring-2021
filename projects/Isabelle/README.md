# The Snake Game in Dart
#### Isabelle Bennett ~ Industry Methods 2021

This is a web-based version of the Snake Game built in Dart. This game uses the HTML5 <canvas> element and dart API to interact with with it and draw the graphics. The snake in this game is represented as a small rectangle/cell. It will use the Dart Point class members x and y for storing two-dimensional coordinates.

### How to Play:
As the user, you will control the movement of a virtual snake. Each time you move the snake with your arrow keys to eat a piece of food, it grows longer. If the head of the snake runs into its body, or the snake goes off the board, the game resets. The goal is to get the snake as long as possible.
