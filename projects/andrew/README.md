# Distributed Computing using Ray

Here I will be using [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/index.html) to run algorithms in parallel.

## Overview

Ray is a project started by Robert Nishihara out of UC Berkeley, with the goal of creating a general distributed computing API. It has a lot of interesting applications with machine learning.

## Setup

Currently I am running Ubuntu 20.04. Tools I will be using Python 3, Pip 3, and Ray.

Ray can be installed with pip or conda.
