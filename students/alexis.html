    <h1>Alexis Tingey</h1>
    <p>Hi all! I'm a senior in computer science at MSU getting ready to graduate with a BS after this spring semester, yay! I currently work in web development with a company here in Bozeman, but my other interests in the field include security, and data analysis. In my free time I like to paint and read, I always love new book recommendations. Check out my LinkedIn and github profiles linked below!</p>
