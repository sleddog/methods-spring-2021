#### Isabelle Bennett ~ Industry Methods 2021

Given an input (n), this program will print numbers from 1 to n. If the number is a multiple of 5, prints 'Buzz', if multiple of 3, prints 'Fizz'. If the input is a multiple of 15, prints 'FizzBuzz'.

### Instructions
Running this program will require a C compiler.
1. Download this file
2. Change to the fizzbuzz directory
2. Run this command in your terminal:
```
./script.sh
```
this will run the script that will ask for an input number and then run the fizzbuzz solution.
