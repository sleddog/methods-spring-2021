# Go implementation of FizzBuzz, Alexis Tingey

### **Overview:**
This folder contains files contributing to a fizzbuzz solution written in Go. This is a super fun coding challenge used in many coding interviews!!
* "fizzbuzz.go" - This is the main source code that solves fizzbuzz.
* "run.sh" - This is the script used to run the above file.

### **Instructions:**
**Downloading Go** 
1. If you do not already have Go on your machine, click the link below and follow the instructions.   
https://golang.org/dl/
2. Make sure you have your environment set up correctly to run .go files. Specifically check "GOROOT" and "GOPATH", as these initially caused me IDE issues. Depending on your editor, the following link might be of help with the above problem.

**Running the program**
1. Download both fizzbuzz.go and run.sh from this directory.  
2. In your terminal, run `./run.sh ` followed by the number you'd like to use as the upper bound in the fizzbuzz problem.  

**Sample Output**     

        $ ./run.sh 9
        1
        2
        fizz
        4
        buzz
        fizz
        7
        8
        fizz
