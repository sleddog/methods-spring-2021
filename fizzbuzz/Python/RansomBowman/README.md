# FizzBuzzPython
FizzBuzz in Python 3

Make sure Python 3 is installed and set to path

This program takes an input number from the user and then iterates from 1 to
the provided number, printing each number and printing Fizz if the number of
the iteration is a multiple of 3 instead of the number, and Buzz if the 
iterated number is a multiple of 5 instead of the number. At a number that is 
both a multiple of 3 and 5 (i.e. 15), FizzBuzz is printed instead of 15.

Enter the command ./run.sh [Your number here] and it will FizzBuzz the number you entered where the brackets are at.
