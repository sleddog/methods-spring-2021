# FizzBuzz Solution in Java
## Introduction
This is a solution to the Fizz Buzz problem using Java. 
The user is prompted to enter a number _n_.
The program will then print out each number, starting at 1, up to and including _n_ on its own line.
If the number is divisible by 3, it will be replaced by "Fizz."
If the number is divisible by 5, it will be replaced by "Buzz."
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it will be replaced by "FizzBuzz."

### Instructions
Before proceding further, the user should check that Java is installed on their machine. 
This can be done using the following command `java -version`. If Java is not installed, the user can download the JDK by clicking the following link.
